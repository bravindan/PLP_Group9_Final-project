**PROJECT DESCRIPTION**
Our aim was to create application that predicts the taxi fare a passenger is supposed to pay moving from one location to another.We used machine learning algorithms more specificaly the k-Nearest Neighbors. 

First we imported the necessary libraries and read our file into a dataframe called fare.

To clean our data, we 
1.Droped rows containing missing values.
2.Changed the object type data to integer type,because machine learning only works with numerical data.

This app should takes our data set into a training and test set. Then, we use knn algorithm, fit the model on the training set, and make predictions of the fare and return that value.

**LIBRARIES USED**
Pandas
numpy 
seaborn 
matplotlib.pyplot
